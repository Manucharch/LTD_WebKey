    "time4": "The day is divided into 24 hours, each hour divided into 60 minutes, each minute divided into 60 seconds. A second is 1 / (24 × 60 × 60) of the day. Historically, a day was defined as the mean solar day; i.e., the average time between two successive occurrences of local apparent solar noon.",

    "mole3": "In the International System of Units (SI), the mole is formally defined as the unit of amount of substance. It represents the quantity of a substance that contains as many elementary entities (atoms, molecules, ions, etc.) as there are atoms in exactly 0.012 kilograms of carbon-12. This definition establishes a fixed numerical value for the Avogadro constant, which is approximately  6.022 × 10^23 elementary entities per mole. Therefore, one mole of any substance contains approximately 6.022 × 10^23 particles.",
    "mole4": "Atomic weight or molecular weight divided by the molar mass constant, 1 g/mol.",

    "candela1": "cd",
    "candela2": "Luminous Intensity",
    "candela3": "In the International System of Units (SI), the candela (cd) is formally defined as the unit of luminous intensity. It is defined based on the spectral sensitivity of the human eye to light of different wavelengths. Specifically, the candela is defined such that the luminous intensity of a light source emitting monochromatic radiation at a frequency of 540 × 10^12 hertz (corresponding to green light) is 1 / 683 watt per steradian. This definition ensures that the candela is based on human perception of light and provides a standardized measure of the brightness of a light source.",
    "candela4": "Prior to the establishment of the candela, various units such as candles, oil lamps, and gas lamps were used, but they lacked precision and consistency."
